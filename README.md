- 👋 Hi, I’m @jmcmul6 (Jacob)
- 👀 I’m interested in honing my skills, I have a long background in technology and programming.  However, I have not used my skills professionally since highchool many years ago.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever I can get my hands on, I thrive in situations where I am presented with problems that require solutions with well defined guidelines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where I can participate in the back-end of development.  I also enjoy working the front-end of projects although I do poorly when designing 
        creating asthetic pages.
- 📫 You can reach me at jmcmul6@wgu.edu
